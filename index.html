		<p>Birds of prey can live for many years. They have special characteristics that set them apart from other birds, which include: curved claws, sharp feet, strong eyesight, and hooked beaks. They are also known as raptors, a term that comes from the Latin word 'rapere' which means to capture. A few examples are barn owls, bald eagles, great horned owls, and red tail hawks.</p>
			
		<p>Each predator can be located mainly in forests. Barn owls, great horned owls, and bald eagles live in forests, except for red tailed hawks, they live in rainforests. Each predator has talons on it's feet, which they use to grab their prey.</p>
