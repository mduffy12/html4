Birds of prey have special characteristics that set them apart from other birds, which include: curved claws, sharp feet, strong eyesight, and hooked beaks. They are also known as raptors, a term that comes from the Latin word 'rapere' which means to capture. A few examples are barn owls, bald eagles, great horned owls, and red tail hawks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="tables/lifespans.html">Click here to see the various lifespans of selected species.</a></p>
